# GunNut

## Changelog

### 1.2.3(01/09/20)
Values for fire rate are time between shots so less time equals better fire rate.

#### VANILLA

- M1A: Now improves from DMR class instead semi-automatic carbine class (Compared to the marksman rifle it has faster rate of fire and less range).
- MP7A1: Changed nickname to "Hornet" and increased fire rate from 11 to 7.
- SA-58: Increased burstshotcount to 4 from 3.
- Bullpup PKP: Increased overall acuraccy around 5%.

#### COMBAT EXTENDED

Keep in mind that some of the changes to vanilla carry to CE like the M1A upgrade.

- M1A: Increased fire rate from 0.3 to 0.2.
