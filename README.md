# Changelog

### 1.2.7(23/09/20)
DISCLAIMER: This update will throw a small error on existing saves, is harmless and should be gone the next time you save/load.

- Fixed some Gun Nut weapons spawning on "low tech" factions like vanilla expanded settlers.
- Added the "usable with shield" functionality to the Glock 17 and the MP7A1 so now they can be used with any vanilla expanded shield when CE is not present.
- (NEW!) Mod Settings: you can disable guns individually and remove the nicknames if you don't have any duplicates or prefer to do so.   

### 1.2.6(20/09/20)
- Improved some things in most of the textures, cannons, scopes and drum mags should look better now.
- Fixed the R700's soundFX now is suppressed and you can hear the bolt after each shot.
- Fixed the position of all the guns so they look better when the pawns are shooting them.
- Changed the package ID and some other small things in preparation for the release of a second mod. 

### 1.2.5(14/09/20)
- I remade all textures while learning Adobe Illustrator. Some are changed, but for the most part should feel the same. The sprites now look perfect on crafting menus, research menus etc.
- (!NEW) One las addition to the mod the Red Rebel ice pick.

### 1.2.4(12/09/20)
- Moved the position and reduced the cost of the research when VWE is not present in vanilla.
- Balanced the AK-105 to be more in line with the AKSU when using CE.
- Increased the crafting cost of all guns in vanilla to be more in line with other guns.
- Balanced the crafting cost of most guns in CE to account for the ammo cost/ work speed penalties.
- Removed some weapon tags so now only high tier pawns will spawn with Gun Nut weapons in vanilla.

### 1.2.3(01/09/20)
Values for fire rate are time between shots so less time equals better fire rate.

#### VANILLA

- M1A: Now improves from DMR class instead semi-automatic carbine class (Compared to the marksman rifle it has faster rate of fire and less range).
- MP7A1: Changed nickname to "Hornet" and increased fire rate from 11 to 7.
- SA-58: Increased burstshotcount to 4 from 3.
- Bullpup PKP: Increased overall accuracy around 5%.

Keep in mind that some of the changes to vanilla carry to CE like the M1A upgrade.

- M1A: Increased fire rate from 0.3 to 0.2.
- Saiga 12K: Can't be used in full auto anymore, still really fast in semi-auto.

Some values for fire rates slipped on the original patch:
